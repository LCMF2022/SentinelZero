# SentinelZero

**Post-Audit DeFi Listing Risk Intelligence Engine**

SentinelZero is a research-driven framework designed to assess
**structural, governance, liquidity, and oracle-related risks**
in DeFi protocols **after audits have been completed**, with
explicit focus on **exchange listing and monitoring decisions**.

Audits reduce bugs.  
They do not eliminate risk.

SentinelZero focuses on what happens **after deployment**.

---

## Problem Statement

Most DeFi security failures are not caused by unknown bugs,
but by **systemic and structural weaknesses** that audits do not cover.

Exchanges and institutional teams still rely on:
- Manual risk analysis
- Subjective judgment
- Fragmented data sources

This creates inconsistency, blind spots, and operational risk.

SentinelZero standardizes post-audit risk intelligence.

---

## Target Users

- Crypto Exchanges (listing & monitoring teams)
- DeFi Protocols (post-audit risk visibility)
- Institutional Investors
- Research & Compliance Teams

---

## Core Risk Pillars

SentinelZero evaluates listing viability across three primary pillars:

1. **Liquidity Risk**
2. **Governance Risk**
3. **Oracle Dependency Risk**

Each pillar produces **explicit, explainable findings**.

---

## How It Works

1. Ingests public protocol data
2. Detects structural risk signals
3. Translates signals into risk findings
4. Produces a transparent risk score and report

## Output Example

SentinelZero Listing Risk Report
Protocol: ExampleProtocol

Liquidity Risk:

Low TVL relative to listing standards

Sharp 7-day liquidity decline

Governance Risk:

Upgradeable contracts controlled by small multisig

Oracle Dependency Risk:

Single oracle dependency with low-liquidity feed

Overall Risk Score: 72 / 100
