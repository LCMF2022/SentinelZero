SentinelZero is a **data-driven framework** designed to identify **structural, behavioral, and governance risks in DeFi protocols after audits**.  

> ⚠️ Audits reduce bugs but do not eliminate risks. SentinelZero focuses on what happens **post-deployment**.

---

## 🧩 Problem Solved

Despite billions lost in DeFi due to post-audit failures, there were no reliable tools for continuous monitoring.  
SentinelZero provides intelligence based on governance, liquidity, and oracle data to mitigate risks.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Validates protocol JSONs against strict schemas
- Monitors governance, liquidity, and oracles
- Automatically generates reports in **TXT**, **HTML**, **PDF**, and **Dashboard HTML**
- Integrates multiple APIs (Coingecko, DefiLlama)
- Pre-production and full simulation routines included
- Built-in unit testing with **pytest**

---

## 💻 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LCMF2022/SentinelZero.git
cd SentinelZero
````

Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux / Mac**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ⚙️ Usage

**Run full simulation (pre-production):**

```powershell
.\run_preprod.ps1
```

This will:

* Copy tests to the root (if needed)
* Activate the virtual environment
* Install dependencies
* Run the full simulation (`run_full_simulation.py`)
* Generate reports in `logs/` and `reports/`

**Run simulation directly:**

```bash
python run_full_simulation.py
```

**Run unit tests only:**

```bash
pytest tests/
```
