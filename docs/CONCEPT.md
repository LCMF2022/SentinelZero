# SentinelZero — Concept

SentinelZero is based on the principle that
**post-audit risk is primarily structural, not accidental**.

The project focuses on risks that emerge from:
- Liquidity behavior
- Governance control
- External dependencies (oracles)

These factors are commonly evaluated manually during
exchange listing processes.

SentinelZero aims to:
- Standardize this analysis
- Make it explainable
- Reduce subjectivity

The long-term vision is to establish a
**post-audit risk intelligence standard** for DeFi listings.
